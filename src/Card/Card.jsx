          There once was 8 people in a room. It was a gloomy and wet day
          outside. Wet enough to fill the water reserves in Oslo. After a long
          day <a href="#">Egill</a> decided to open a window to let some fresh air in. Little
          did he know that the wind was picking up and as Olivia went to close
          it, the wind picked her up and through her out of the window! Thank
          goodness Yesi was quick to her feet and ran down to catch her just in
          time to prevent Olivias face to hit the pavement.
        </p>

          Sounds come from above. Sudden streams of baked good were now flying
          out of the window. Was it the wind? Minutes later Isabella showed up
          in the window, laughing and pointing as the croissant hit the ground.
          Luckily PÃ¥l knew what to do and picked Vando up by his feet and used
          him as a fishing nett to catch the baked good while still in the air.
          Saving the workshop from hunger and anger.
